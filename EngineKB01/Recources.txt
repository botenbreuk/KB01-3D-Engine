| Render Engine |
This module is responsible for everything that you see on the screen. A graphic API like OpenGL or Direct3D must be used in render engine. The main idea in my design is seperating jobs. In order to build a powerfull, flexible and stable you have to take control of every object and the memory. So I group associated classes and create a manager class in order to manage them. Let’s take a look at my design;

Scene Manager
Model Manager
GUI Manager
Light Manager
Camera Manager
Resource Manager
Animation Manager
